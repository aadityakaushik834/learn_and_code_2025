Vertical Formatting Standards:

    File Structure Order Every class must follow this order:
    1. Package declaration
    2.Imports
    3.Constants
    4.Fields
    5.Constructor(s)
    6.Public methods
    7.Private helper methods

    Newspaper Metaphor:
    High-level methods must appear at the top of the class.
    Low-level implementation details must appear later.

    Blank Lines:
    Use blank lines to separate different concepts.
    Do not use blank lines between closely related statements.

    Method Ordering:
    Caller methods must appear before the methods they call.

Horizontal Formatting Standards:

    Indentation:
    Use consistent indentation for all blocks.

    Spacing Rules:
    Add spaces around operators (=, +, -, >, <, ||).

    Alignment:
    Do not align variables or parameters using extra spaces.

    Variable Formatting Rules:
    Group related variables together without blank lines.

    Non-Negotiable Rule:
    Formatting changes must never alter program logic.
